```

## When its the value of an local var assignment, breaks are preserved as authored

```ruby
h = {
  one: 2,
  three: 4
}
```

After:

```ruby
h = {
  one: 2,
  three: 4
}
```

## When its the value of an index assignment, breaks are preserved as authored

Before:

```ruby
h[0] = {
  one: 2,
  three: 4
}
```

After:

```ruby
h[0] = {
  one: 2,
  three: 4
}
```

## When its an argument of a setter, breaks are preserved as authored

Before:

```ruby
h[0] = {
  one: 2,
  three: 4
}
```

After:

```ruby

  one: 2,
  three: 4
}
```

## Breaks when necessary

Before:

```ruby
{ one: 2, three: "really long values", four: "another really long value", long_key_name: "value" }
```

After:

```ruby
{
  one: 2,
  three: "really long values",
  four: "another really long value",
  long_key_name: "value"
}
```

## Formats recursively

Before:

```ruby
{ one: 2, three: "really long values",
 five: { one: 2, three: "really long values", four: "another really long value", long_key_name: "value" },
  four: "another really long value", long_key_name: "value"
}
```

After:

```ruby
{
  one: 2,
  three: "really long values",
  five: {
    one: 2,
    three: "really long values",
    four: "another really long value",
    long_key_name: "value"
  },
  four: "another really long value",
  long_key_name: "value"
}
```

## When beg/end is implicit, does not add brackets

Before:

```ruby
