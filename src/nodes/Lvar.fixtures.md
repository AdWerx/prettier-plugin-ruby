# Lvar Node Formatting

Represents access to a local variable (i.e. `foo`)

Parser knows that it's a local variable because:
1. there was an assignment to this variable **before** accessing it
2. it's an argument of the current method / block
3. it's been implicitly declared by `MatchWithLvasgn` node

Otherwise it's a method call (see `Send`)
