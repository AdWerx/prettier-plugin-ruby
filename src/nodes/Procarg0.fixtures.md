Represents a sole block argument (e.g. `|foo|`)

Block that takes a single array argument automatically expands it.
Adding trailing comma after block argument disables this behavior (and then the only argument is emitted as `Arg`).

## Fails because no tests are written

Before:
```ruby
foo
```

After:
```ruby
bar
```
