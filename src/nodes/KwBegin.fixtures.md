<!-- BEGIN_AUTOGENERATED -->
# KwBegin Node Formatting

Represents an explicit `begin; end` block.

The reason why it's different is that
```text
begin; foo; end while cond
```
is a post-while loop (same with post-until loop)

# KwBegin Formatting

## Fails because no tests are written

Before:
```ruby
foo
```

After:
```ruby
bar
```
