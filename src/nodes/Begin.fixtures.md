<!-- BEGIN_AUTOGENERATED -->
# Begin Node Formatting

Represents compound statement (i.e. a multi-statement)

Basically all blocks of code are wrapped into `Begin` node (e.g. method/block body, rescue/ensure handler etc)
<!-- END_AUTOGENERATED -->
# Begin Formatting

## Fails because no tests are written

Before:
```ruby
foo
```

After:
```ruby
bar
```
